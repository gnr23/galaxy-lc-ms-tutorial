# LC-MS/MS Metabolomics Tutorial (Galaxy)

## 🔬 Project Description
This repository follows the Galaxy tutorial for LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis.
The goal is to understand the processing pipeline of raw mass spectrometry data and extract meaningful biological insight.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `raw_data/`: Raw mzML files or data obtained from the Galaxy server
- `notebooks/`: Notes, markdown files, and Jupyter notebooks
- `results/`: Output from data processing, figures, tables

## 🚀 Tutorial Source
Based on the Galaxy Training Network tutorial:
👉 [LC-MS analysis (Metabolomics)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metabolomics/tutorials/lcms/tutorial.html#preprocessing-with-xcms)

## Questions:
What are the main steps of untargeted LC-MS data processing for metabolomic analysis?

How to conduct metabolomic data analysis from preprocessing to annotation using Galaxy?

## Objectives:
To comprehend the diversity of LC-MS metabolomic data analysis.

To get familiar with the main steps constituting a metabolomic workflow for untargeted LC-MS analysis.

To evaluate the potential of a workflow approach when dealing with LC-MS metabolomic data.

## ✅ Step 1: Galaxy Login and History Setup
- Go to [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu/)
- Create an account or log in
- Create a new history: `LCMSMS Tutorial`

## ✅ Step 2: Data Upload
- Upload the demo data as described in the tutorial (e.g. via shared data → data libraries)
- Check that the data are in `.mzML` format

## ✅ Step 3: Start the workflow
- Launch the pre-defined workflow or follow step-by-step
- First tool: `XCMS input data` (set parameters as per tutorial)
