‚ÄúSelect history‚Äù: the history we want to import the data to (or create a new one)
Click on Import

## Step 2: Data preparation for XCMS: MSnbase readMSData
- Launch the pre-defined workflow from tools menu typing Msnbase
  we get a Dataset collection containing 9 dataset. The datasets are some RData objects with the rdata.msnbase.raw datatype.
- Now that we have prepared the data, we can begin with the first XCMS extraction step: peakpicking. However, before beginning to extract meaningful information from the raw data, we may be interested in visualising your chromatograms. This can be of particular interest if you want to check whether we should consider discarding some range of your analytical sequence (some scan or retention time (RT) ranges).

To do so, we can use a tool that is called xcms plot chromatogram tool that will plot each sample‚Äôs chromatogram (see dedicated section further). However, to use this tool, we may need additional information about your samples for colouring purpose. 

Thus, we may need to upload into Galaxy a table containing metadata of our samples (a sampleMetadata file).

##Step 3 : Importing a sample metadata file
 - A sampleMetadata file corresponds to a table containing information about the samples (= sample metadata).

A sample metadata file contains various information for each of your raw files:

--Classes which will be used during the preprocessing steps
--Analytical batches which will be useful for a batch correction step, along with sample types (pool/sample) and injection order
--Different experimental conditions which can be used for statistics
--information about samples that you want to keep, in a column format
--The content of your sample metadata file has to be filled by you, since it is not contained in your raw data. Note that you can either:

how to Upload an existing metadata file:
Use a template to create one (because it can be painful to get the sample list without misspelling or omission)
Generate a template with the xcms get a sampleMetadata file tool tool
Fill it using your favorite table editor (Excel, LibreOffice etc.)
Upload it within Galaxy

In this Tutorial we open xcms and get a samplemetadata file from tools and load the xcms get a sampleMetadata file tool with the following parameters: param-collection ‚ÄúRData file‚Äù: the sacurine.raw.RData collection output from MSnbase readMSData 

##From this tool, we obtain a tabular file (meaning a tab-separated text file) with a first column of identifiers and a second column called class which is empty for the moment (only ‚Äò.‚Äô for each sample). we can now download this file by clicking on the galaxy-save icon.

Tip: Changing the datatype
Click on the galaxy-pencil pencil icon for the dataset to edit its attributes
In the central panel, click galaxy-chart-select-data Datatypes tab on the top
In the galaxy-chart-select-data Assign Datatype, select your desired datatype from ‚ÄúNew Type‚Äù dropdown
Tip: you can start typing the datatype into the field to filter the dropdown menu
Click the Save button

## Step 4:Getting an overview of your samples‚Äô chromatograms

xcms plot chromatogram
xcms plot chromatogram tool with the following parameters:
‚ÄúRData file‚Äù: sacurine.raw.RData (collection)
‚ÄúSample metadata file‚Äù: sampleMetadata_completed.tsv we uploaded previously
This tool generates Base Peak Intensity Chromatograms (BPIs) and Total Ion Chromatograms (TICs).

## Step 5: 1st XCMS Step

The XCMS solution provides two different algorithms to perform chromatographic peak detection: matchedFilter and centWave. Here we use centWave

for each of your data files independently.

1. the algorithm detects series of scans with close values of m/z. They are called ‚Äòregion of interest‚Äô (ROI). The m/z deviation is defined by the user. The tolerance value should be set according to the mass spectrometer accuracy.
On these regions of interest, a second derivative of a Gaussian model is applied to these consecutive scans in order to define the extracted ion chromatographic peak. The Gaussian model is defined by the peak width which corresponds to the standard deviation of the Gaussian model. Depending on the shape, the peak is added to the peak list of the current sample.
2. At the end of the algorithm, a list of peaks is obtained for each sample. This list is then considered to represent the content of your sample; if an existing peak is not considered a peak at this step, then it can not be considered in the next steps of pre-processing.

peakpicking step with the xcms findChromPeaks (xcmsSet) tool
xcms findChromPeaks (xcmsSet) tool with the following parameters:
‚ÄúRData file‚Äù: sacurine.raw.RData (collection)
‚ÄúExtraction method for peaks detection‚Äù: CentWave - chromatographic peak detection using the centWave method
‚ÄúMax tolerated ppm m/z deviation in consecutive scans in ppm‚Äù: 3
‚ÄúMin,Max peak width in seconds‚Äù: 5,20
In Advanced Options:
‚ÄúPrefilter step for for the first analysis step (ROI detection)‚Äù: 3,5000
‚ÄúNoise filter‚Äù: 1000
leave the other parameters with their default values.

obtain a dataset collection containing one RData file per sample, with independent lists of ions. 
To get all this files together to identify which ions are shared between samples, XCMS provides a function that is called groupChromPeaks (or group). But before proceeding to this grouping step, first you need to group your individual RData files into a single one.

## Step 6: Gathering the different samples in one Rdata file

Tool = to merge the different RData files into a single one: xcms findChromPeaks Merger 
he tool also provides de possibility to take into account a sampleMetadata file. To treat part of your samples a different way when proceeding to the grouping step using xcms groupChromPeaks (group)

For example if in the analytical sequence some blank samples (your injection solvent) that you want to extract along with your biological samples to be able to use them as a reference for noise estimation and noise filtering. 

xcms findChromPeaks Merger tool with the following parameters:
‚ÄúRData file‚Äù: sacurine.raw.xset.RData (collection)
‚ÄúSample metadata file‚Äù: Nothing selected
Click on param-collection Dataset collection in front of the input parameter you want to supply the collection to.
Select the collection you want to use from the list

we do not want to separate the samples according to groups, so we do not provide the sampleMetadata when executing the Merger tool.

The tool generates a single RData file containing information from all the samples in the dataset collection input.

## Step 7: Second XCMS step: determining shared ions across samples

in order to obtain a single matrix of ions intensities for all samples. This process is called grouping
aligns ions extracted with close retention time and close m/z values in the different samples
 an algorithm is used to detect region of retention time with high density of ions based on a gaussian modenl
the grouping is defined by the SD of the model.

-Each picture represents the peak density across samples, 
-plotting the corresponding Gaussian model which width is defined by the bandwidth parameter. 
-Each red dot corresponds to a sample. The plot allows to assess the quality of alignment. T
